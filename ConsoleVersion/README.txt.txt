Hello!

Welcome to the brave (and small) crowd of people willing (and brave) enough to use the console version of the program.

The program is the console_version.exe file found in the "dist" directory. Look there!

Once in, you will be using a menu of command hotkeys. Just type one of the keys listed and hit enter to execute the corresponding command. The commands will let you add criteria to your list to search, change the pivot city, execute a search, etc. 

After the command, you will need to press enter again to display the commands and hotkeys again. Just wait until the system does not prompt you to enter anything else.

GLHF! (Good luck, have fun)
