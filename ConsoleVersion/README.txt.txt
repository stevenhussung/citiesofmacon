Hello!

Welcome to the brave (and small) crowd of people willing (and brave) enough to use the console version of the program.

The program is the console_version.exe file found in the "dist" directory. Look there!

Once in, you will be using a menu of command hotkeys. Just type one of the keys listed and hit enter to execute the corresponding command. The commands will let you add criteria to your list to search, change the pivot city, execute a search, etc. 

The console version returns a much larger number of results. You can also add as many criteria as you want, and it will actually show you the computed "Euclidean distance" between your pivot city and the city shown. 

On the flipside, it's in a console. It doesn't look pretty, and there aren't visuals to help you interpret your results.

GLHF! (Good luck, have fun)
